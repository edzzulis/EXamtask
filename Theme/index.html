						<p>We’re pleased to announce that Blade & Soul releases in North America and Europe at 12AM EST on January 19, 2016! </p>
					<p>Available in fully localized English, French, and German, players from around the world will be able to experience the fantastical kung fu world of Blade & Soul. Featuring 7 classes—from the menacing Destroyer, to the quick-footed Blade Dancer—players will explore settings deeply rooted in ancient mythologies, and be able to master the martial arts as they seek revenge in a gripping and breathtaking story </p>
					<p> Founder’s Packs offer a number of benefits and bonuses, and will continue to be sold until Head Start—an early-access period for Founder’s Pack owners—begins on January 15. Those who have purchased the higher tier Disciple or Master Founder’s Pack will also be able to reserve names for their character ahead of time; with name reservations beginning on January 11. More information on the name reservation process is to follow.</p>
					<p> At launch, Blade & Soul will have a max level of 45, with access to the 1v1 Arena, and two dungeons not seen in our recent Closed Beta tests: Blackram Supply Chain, and E. Fleet Supply Chain. A regular cadence of content updates and patches are planned and in-progress, and we’ll have more information on upcoming content soon after release.</p>
					<p> We want to thank everyone who has followed the Blade & Soul release in North America and Europe up to this point, and appreciate the love and support you’ve provided. We couldn’t have made this release possible without you!</p>
